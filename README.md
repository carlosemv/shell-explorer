Shell Explorer is a shell that combines a command line interface (CLI) with a graphical user interface (GUI).

That is, it's essentially a combined unix shell + file explorer. Its intended use is as a tool for people learning basic unix command line, especially navigation and file/directory manipulation.

As shown above, each command made either through the GUI or the CLI is simultaneously mirrored (or translated) to the other interface.
